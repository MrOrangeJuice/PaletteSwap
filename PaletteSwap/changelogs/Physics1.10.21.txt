Movement changes:
-Dash has a cooldown on rebounding, so dashing into walls cannot be continually spammed
-You cannot perform a downward dash unless you are midair
-Downward dash is easier to input
-Inputting left and right simultaneously on keyboard results in Fern skidding to a halt, and are treated as if no directional input is given
-Fern will always dash the way he is facing now
-Fern can not visually turn around during a dash
-Q and U cycle palettes left, E and I cycle right
-Removed backwards dash
-Removed long jump

Potential Bugs, Possible Tech:
-Dashing into a wall you are already colliding with results in having no cooldown

Known Bugs:
-Game reads SHIFT input while window isn't in focus
