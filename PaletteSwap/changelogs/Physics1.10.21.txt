Movement changes:
-Dash has a cooldown on rebounding, so dashing into walls cannot be continually spammed
-You cannot perform a downward dash unless you are midair
-Downward dash is easier to input
-Inputting left and right simultaneously on keyboard results in Fern skidding to a halt, and are treated as if no directional input is given
-Fern will always dash the way he is facing now
-Fern can not visually turn around during a dash

Visual changes:
-Sprite swaps have an optional 'slow mode' for delayed but cleaner transition in some cases- this will be changed for something better shortly

Potential Bugs, Possible Tech:
-Jumping while dashing results in a very large jump
-Dashing into a wall you are already colliding with results in having no cooldown
-A backwards dash can be performed

Known Bugs:
-Game reads inputs while window isn't in focus
